# TWRP/SHRP/Orange Fox Recovery Device Tree For Xperia 1 II (pdx203)

## Xperia 1 II (Codename pdx203)

### This device tree can only compile Android 10 based Recovery now.

### Almost everything works, But Recovery will not be able to use, if you try to use this recovery on Android 12 firmware.

> This Device Tree is based on [mauronofrio](https://github.com/mauronofrio)'s instantnoodle(Oneplus 8) TWRP device tree and  [sjll](https://github.com/sjllls)'s Griffin(Xperia 1) TWRP device tree. I am sincerely sorry for missing the commits history（Because of my shit-like operation at the time）. So I wanna write this credit list 
>
> To Thank those kinda bro who help me to build it and fix it !
